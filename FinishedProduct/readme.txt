llmCOOL.zip contains all the files after they were finished in junypter labs
There are various changes within these files and saved weights/tokenized data that isn't in the unzipped files
the saved weights have only gone through 3 epochs of 1000 iterations of 64 batches due to time and gpu resources
it has not been fine tuned
it is a very rough draft of an llm that I did for learning and experimenting
sample.py is the python file for sampling llmCOOL.zip, just add it to the directory after extracting
might be overfitted, output is very random?
